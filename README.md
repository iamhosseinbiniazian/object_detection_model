# object detection models


They are several object detection models which have been developed with python and famous deep learning frameworks such as MxNet, Tensorflow and Keras.  deep learning models such as YOLOv3, YOLOv2,RFCN, etc have been implemented in this repository, for all the models there are the training, testing and evaluation process . These models can be used with the PASCAL-VOC and COCO object detection datasets.
-  object detection models
-  MxNet and Tensorflow Deep learning framework 


Text classification

## Installation
install mxnet,tensorflow, keras, numpy, matplotlib python package

## Usage
-in each folder the file's names start with "train"(train.py) is use for training model
-in each folder the file's names start with "test"(test.py) is use for testing model
-in each folder the  file's names  start with "detection"*(detection.py) has been used for production.
